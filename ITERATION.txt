One suggestion we got from play test is that the score is not clear. We bolded the score text and changed the numbers into a score panel to vividly visualize the magnitude relationship of the scores. We propose that this change would make the game juicier. We also received feedback that the round switch is to sudden and not clear so we added round text to indicate the round number and made transitions between each round.

Also, some player gives the feedback that they have no idea why their scores are negative (which is because their character dies for too many times). To further illustrate how the score increases and decreases, we add score adding effect on flags and score deducting effect when player dies. This UI effects make the game goal much clearer and help players understand how their score changes.

According to the instructors' feedback and our own feelings, some parts of the tutorial seems to be a bit abundant. We revised the tutorial by removing the block placement tutorial, and combining the three movement tutorial levels into one.

Moreover, some player indicated that the sound effects were too loud compared to the background music, so we adjusted the sound effect to make it smoother.

Furthermore, players indicated that it is difficult for both players to use keyboard control and some of the keys are not intuitive to use and are hard to remember. Thus, we changed the input system to controllers.

We made the indications clearer. Several students reflect that they are little confused about which block they are control when placing the block, therefore we added indicators with player icons to illustrate which block is the player currently controlling. Also, all players says its' hard to know the effect of the potions. We designed sprites for each potion. Like the shoe sprite for speedup potion, the arm sprite for powerup potion, and the shield for invincibility potion.
