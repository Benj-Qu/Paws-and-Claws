Our gold spike mechanic that the two players could use the given blocks to 
design their way to the flags and color as many flags as possible. They 
will compete with each other when choosing their blocks and building their 
ways towards the flag with the goal that they can get to the flag while 
others cannot.

Operations:
Player1: use AWDS to move blocks & character1, left shift to switch blocks, Z to set the block
Player2: use arrows to move blocks & character2, right shift to switch blocks, M to set the block
